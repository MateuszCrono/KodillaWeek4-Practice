        <h1> Maiden who walks the planet</h1>
        <p> Chapter 1
        <br>
        Yes. No matter where she went.
        <br> <br>
        She had reached the bottom of the lake. But even now Aerith continued to sink.
        <br>
        Her physical body after many years of losing its life was now held deep underwater, covered in plantation that was like powdered snow. It told of how she was now separated from her short twenty-two years of live for eternity. The vessel that had been separated from the soul was going to return slowly to the Great Earth in the pure water. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Aerith's consciousness was moving to the next lower level.
        <br>
        Nothing changed as she breathed lightly in the dust that floated around her. Aerith continued to sink through the heavy layer of precipitation. The only thing she could see was darkness... But it was a warm, tender lightless world where she didn't feel lonely.
        <br> <br> 
        She soon realized that it wasn't dust or mud that she was feeling. Her senses had adjusted so that she could feel the things around her. Her five senses were at a higher level that let her feel the true nature of the objects.
        <br>
        The world she could see now was not of darkness.</p>
